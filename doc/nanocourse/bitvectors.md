This HowTo gives an introduction into compact data structures. It is designed independently of SeqAn but
it covers design patterns and concepts that are the foundations of efficient C++ used throughout the library.

# Motivation

A compact data structure maintains data, and the desired extra data structures over it, in a form that not only uses
less space than usual, but is able to access and query the data in compact form, that is, without decompressing them.
Thus, a compact data structure allows us to fit and efficiently query, navigate, and manipulate much larger datasets
in main memory than what would be possible if we used the data represented in plain form and classical data
structures on top.

# Bitvectors

Bitvectors are fundamental in the implementation of most compact data structures because of their compactness.
For example, they can be used to mark positions of an array or to encode and compress data.
Therefore, an efficient implementation is of utmost importance.

A bitvector is a bit array \f$B[0, n)\f$ of length \f$n\f$ of values \f$v \in {0,1}\f$ (bits).

In C++ there is no type that defines a single bit, such that you could use `std::vector<bit>` for this purpose.
If you would use, let's say, `std::vector<bool>` instead, you would use 1 byte = 8 bit for each entry
(note that many compilers actually optimize this special case to indeed a single bit representation but let's
assume we want a global solution), or even worse `std::vector<int>` which uses 4 byte = 32 bit.

Let us design a compact data structure that stores single bits as values while still supporting the basic operations:

* \f$read(B, i)\f$: returns the bit \f$B[i]\f$, for any \f$0 \leq i < n\f$ in constant time.
* \f$write(B, i, x)\f$: writes the bit \f$x \in {0,1}\f$ to \f$B[i]\f$, for any \f$0 \leq i < n\f$ in constant time.

## A compact representation of bitvectors

As noted above we need to represent bits using larger entities available in the C++ language.
It usually pays off if you choose an integer with the size of a machine word \f$w\f$, which is 64 on modern
architectures, because most compilers offer a special set of functions for integers of this size.
Therefore, we will use the C++ type `uint64_t` for our representation.
In the previous sections we talked about *arrays* of bits, as in a consecutive storage of bits.
In C++ we will the use type `std::vector` for storing values.

\assignment{A compact bitvector}

Implement a new data structure (a `struct`) called `Bitvector` that has a member variable called `data` of type
`std::vector` over `uint64_t`. The constructor should have one parameter that is the number of bits you would
like to store in your bitvector.

If you are inexperienced with C++, take a look at this code snippet and fill in the *TODO*:

\hint
```cpp
#include <cinttypes>
#include <vector>

struct Bitvector // the new data structure
{
    std::vector<uint64_t> data; // the data storage (64 bit integers instead of single bits)

    // The constructor takes one parameter as input called 'count' which is the number of bits you want to store.
    // Your data vector now needs to be resized to store these bits.
    Bitvector(size_t const count)
    {
        data.resize(/*TODO: How many integers do you need to represent `count` bits?*/);
    }
};

int main()
{
    Bitvector B(10); // construct an instance B of type Bitvector that can store at least 10 bits
}
```

### Access the compact bitvector

The bitvector needs to support access to the single bits via a member function `read(i)`,
which returns either `0` or `1` depending on the bit at position `i`.

We now face the problem that we do not store single bits but groups of 64 bits in one `uint64_t` integer.
For example, let a data vector contain the number `17`.

The 64 bit binary representation of `17` is

```
0         8         16        24        32        40        48        56
0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0001
```

It thus represents a group of 64 bits where the bits at position 59 and 63
(starting from the left and 0) are set to 1.

So how do we access single bits within the integer? This can be achieved using bit manipulation.

Read up on basic bit manipulation mechanisms in [this tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_manipulation)
if you are new to this.

\assignment{Reading}

Copy and paste the following implementation of a function into your Bitvector struct
and complete the code:

```cpp
    bool read(size_t const i) const
    {
        // manipulate the bits of the correct entry to identify whether position i is set to 0 or 1
        // return true if the bit at position i is set to 1 and false otherwise.
    }
```

Your function should be able to access the bitvector in constant time (don't use loops)!

Given the following main function

\snippet test/snippet/nanocourse/solution2.cpp main

Your program should output

```
0
```

If you are inexperienced with C++, use the provided code snippet of the `read` function and fill in the *TODOs*:

\hint
```cpp
struct Bitvector
{
    std::vector<uint64_t> data;

    Bitvector(size_t const count)
    {
        data.resize((count + 63) / 64); // the +63 is a trick to round up the fraction.
    }

    bool read(size_t const i) const
    {
        // We need to find the correct group for bit i.
        // For example, if i is 10 it will be the 10th bit in the first 64 bit-group,
        // if i is 70 it will be the 6th bit in the second.
        size_t group_index = /*TODO: In which data entry (group) can we find bit i?*/;

        // Now that we identified the correct entry. We need to know the relative position of i within its group,
        // e.g. for i == 70, the group_index is 1 (second group starting with 0) and the relative position x is 6.
        size_t x = /*TODO: what is the relative position of bit i?*/;

        // Now that we identified the correct entry and relative position,
        // we need to move the bit of interest to the right most position in order to look at it.
        // This can be done using a right shift of (63 - x) positions.
        // If the then use the logical AND operator with 1 (bit representation 0..01)
        // we set every bit but the last to zero, so we have either 0..0 or 0..1 which is either false or true.
        return (data[group_index] >> (63 - x)) & 1;
    }
};
```

### Write to the compact bitvector

We now want to support writing to our bitvector by implementing the member function `write(i, x)`.
This is a bit more tricky so we recommend this as a bonus question for experienced C++ users.
Otherwise you may just copy and paste the solution.

\assignment{Writing}

Complete the following implementation of a function that can access the compact bitvector:

```cpp
    void write(size_t const i, bool const x)
    {
        // ... your implementation goes here
    }
```

## Rank and select

Two very useful operations that a bitvector should support are the following:

* \f$rank_v(B, i)\f$: returns the number of occurrences of bit \f$v \in {0, 1}\f$ in \f$B[0, i)\f$,
for any \f$0 \leq i \leq n\f$. If omitted, we assume \f$v = 1\f$.
* \f$select_v(B, j)\f$: returns the position in \f$B\f$ of the j-th occurrence of bit \f$v \in {0, 1}\f$,
for any \f$j \geq 0\f$; we assume \f$select_v(B, 0) = -1\f$ and \f$select_v(B, j) = n\f$ if \f$j >
rank_v(B, n - 1)\f$. If omitted, we assume \f$v = 1\f$.

We will implement the rank operation for our compact bitvector representation.

### Helper data structures

In order to support rank and select queries we need two helper data structures (given machine world length \f$w\f$):

1. **Superblocks**: We divide the bitvector into superblocks of length \f$s = w \cdot k bits\f$,
   where \f$k\f$ is parameter to choose.
   We then store the rank values at the beginnings of the corresponding superblock in an array \f$R\f$.

2. **Blocks**: We further divide the bitvector into blocks of length \f$w\f$.
   We then store the rank values at the beginnings of the corresponding block,
   **but relatively to their corresponding superblock**, in an array \f$R\f$.

\image html doc/nanocourse/bitvector.png width=800px

\assignment{Data types}

The block and superblock values obviously need to be stored using an arithmetic data type
(e.g. `uint8_t`, `uint16_t`, `uint32_t`, `uint64_t`).
Given an arbitrary bitvector of length n, word length \f$w = 64\f$ bits
and a superblock length of \f$s = 64 * 25 = 1600\f$ bits,
which type would you choose for superblock entries, and which type for block entries and why?

\endassignment

\solution

If a superblock spans 1600 bits, then the last block value within a superblock can at most count 1599 `1s`.
Thus, a `uint16_t` is the smallest type that is still able represent this number
and should be preferred to larger types to reduce the space of the block data structure.

Since we do not know how large our bitvector might be, one should choose a large data type, like `uint64_t`,
to store to prefix sums for the superblock values.

\endsolution

Now that we know which data types to work with, let's implement the data structures.

\assignment{Compute the block and superblock arrays}

Given a bitvector `B` from the previous assignments:
1. Add the member variables `std::vector<uint16_t> blocks` and `std::vector<uint64_t> superblocks`.
2. Add the member variables `uint16_t block_size` and `uint16_t superblock_size`.
3. Add a member function `void construct(size_t const new_block_size = 64, size_t const new_superblock_size = 512)`
that overwrites the member variables `block_size` and `superblock_size`
and then fills the member variables `blocks` and `superblocks`.

With the following main function:

\snippet test/snippet/nanocourse/solution4.cpp main

your program should print the following:

```
Superblocks:
0 25 50 75

Blocks:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24
```

If you are inexperienced with C++, you can use the following code snippet and fill in the *TODOs*:

\hint

```cpp
    // The member function takes two parameters:
    // `block_size` which is defaulted to be 64 and `superblock_size` which is defaulted to 512.
    // Defaulted means that you can also call the function without parameters `construct()`.
    void construct(size_t const new_block_size = 64, size_t const new_superblock_size = 512)
    {
        block_size = new_block_size;            // overwrite the member variable with the new value
        superblock_size = new_superblock_size;  // overwrite the member variable with the new value

        size_t number_of_bits = data.size() * 64;

        // resize the two arrays of blocks and superblocks
        blocks.resize(/*TODO: how many blocks do I need?*/);
        superblocks.resize(/*TODO: how many super blocks do I need?*/);

        // keep track of the current (super)block
        size_t block_pos{0};
        size_t super_block_pos{0};

        // keep track of the current (super)block count value
        uint16_t block_count{0};
        uint64_t super_block_count{0};

        // iterate over the data member and count the number of 1's.
        for (size_t i = 0; i < number_of_bits; ++i)
        {
            if (/*TODO: When do we reach the end of a block? Hint: Use the modulo operation (%) on i*/)
            {
                if (/*TODO: When do we reach the end of a superblock? Hint: Use the modulo operation (%) on i*/)
                {
                    super_block_count += block_count; // update superblock count

                    // TODO: store the value of super_block_count into the current superblock entry (at super_block_pos)

                    ++super_block_pos; // move to the next position
                    block_count = 0;   // reset block count
                }

                // TODO: store value of block_count in the current block entry (at super_block_pos)

                ++block_pos; // move to the next position
            }

            if (read(i) == true)
                ++block_count;
        }
    }
```
\endhint
\endassignment

\solution

\include test/snippet/nanocourse/solution4.cpp

Note that most compilers provide special bit operations on integers.
One example is **popcount** that counts the number of `1s` in an integer.
This would be very helpful in our application because instead of iterating over every position in our bitvector `B`
we could directly use popcount on every entry of `B` to get the value for the block
(of course this only works since we chose the block size wisely).

The code could then look like this (**This is compiler specific (GCC)**):

\include test/snippet/nanocourse/solution4_intrinsic.cpp

If you have some time to spare, increase the size of `B`, and do some runtime tests for the construction.
The construction using popcount should be considerably faster.

### Rank queries

Now that we have the helper data structures of block and superblocks,
we will implement the actual support for rank queries.

\assignment{Rank queries}

Implement a member function

```cpp
    uint64_t rank(size_t const i) const
    {
        // your code here
    }
```

that returns the number of occurrences of bit \f$v \in {0, 1}\f$ in \f$B[0, i)\f$,
for any \f$0 \leq i \leq n\f$; in particular \f$rank_v(B, 0) = 0\f$. If omitted, we assume \f$v = 1\f$.

Use the same example of the bitvector and block/superblock sizes as in the previous assignment.

Given the following main function:

\snippet test/snippet/nanocourse/solution5.cpp main

Your program should output

```
1
1
2
```

If you are inexperienced with C++, you can use the following code snippet:

\hint
```cpp
    uint64_t rank(size_t const i) const
    {
        uint64_t rank{0};

        rank += superblocks[/*TODO: the position of the superblock entry to use*/];
        rank += blocks[/*TODO: the position of the block entry to use*/];

        // go through the remaining block bit-by-bit
        for (size_t j = (i / block_size) * block_size; j < i; ++j)
        {
            /*TODO: increase `rank` by 1 if there is a 1 at position j in data. Hint: Use a function we implemented.*/
        }
        return rank;
    }
```
